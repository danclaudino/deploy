Show how to set a XACC_DIR environment variable first and pass to cmake
Using TNQVM Show with xacc alone, show with qcor at c++ and python jit level</description></item><item><title>Using an Optimizer</title><link>https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/users/using_optimizer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/users/using_optimizer/</guid><description>Optimizers have proven ubiquitous across variational quantum computation. AIDE-QC is focused on the development of novel optimization strategies for noisy quantum co-processors. To deploy these strategies in an extensible and modular way, the AIDE-QC software stack puts forward and Optimizer interface / concept that can be implemented for particular optimization strategies. Currently, we provide a number of implementations, some of which delegate to popular optimization libraries that provide a wealth of gradient-based and derivative free algorithms.</description></item></channel></rss>
